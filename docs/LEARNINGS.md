### L-001: Non-tmux alternate screen sessions need a viewport freeze layer to support scroll during streaming
- status: active
- category: architecture
- source: /harness:bug 2026-03-20
- branch: master

When building terminal features for alternate screen apps (Claude Code, vim), remember that xterm.js has no scrollback in alternate screen mode (baseY=0). Scroll events reach the TUI app correctly, but the TUI's continuous re-rendering during streaming immediately overrides scroll position. Any feature requiring user-controlled scrolling in non-tmux alternate screen sessions must implement an intermediary buffer layer (screen snapshotting or output gating) — simply forwarding scroll events is insufficient. Tmux copy-mode provides this layer automatically, which is why tmux sessions don't have this problem.

### L-002: Mobile WebSocket reconnection must not rely solely on `onclose` — use `visibilitychange` + heartbeat
- status: active
- category: architecture
- source: /harness:bug 2026-03-21
- branch: master

When a mobile browser backgrounds an app, the OS silently kills TCP connections but the browser may not fire WebSocket `onclose` for 30-60+ seconds (or never). Never rely solely on `onclose` for reconnection. Always add: (1) a `visibilitychange` listener that probes socket health when the page becomes visible, and (2) a periodic client-side heartbeat with a response timeout to detect zombie connections. `readyState === OPEN` is unreliable on zombie sockets — always verify with an actual ping/pong exchange.
